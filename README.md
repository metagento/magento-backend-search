# Magento 1 - Backend search by Metagento

When your website is big and you have many modules installed, sometimes you may want to find a menu item or a setting but you don’t remember where it is.
It will take a lot of time because each module has many settings.

Magento provides a search box in backend, however it only gives results for Product, Customer, Order. It doesn’t search in Menu and Configuration, our module can help you with this.

Features:

- Search menu items in backend

- Search setting fields in Configuration ( with link and path )

Installation steps:
- Enable all cache types

- Download and unzip the package

- Upload to your magento root directory

- Click on "Flush Cache Storage" button in System -> Cache Management
